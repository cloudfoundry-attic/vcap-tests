    Given I have my running application named rails_console_test_app
    When I first access console of my application
    Then I should get responses irb():001:0>  from console of my application
    When I send command app.class to console of my application
    Then I should get responses app.class,=> ActionDispatch::Integration::Session,irb():002:0>  from console of my application
    Then I close console
